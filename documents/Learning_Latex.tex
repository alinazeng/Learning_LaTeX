\section{For Forever}
Dear Evan Hansen, today is going to be a great day and here is why. \newline
You can \textsl{lean} on me!
You can \textbf{count} on me~ \newline


\subsection{All we see is light, for forever}
Excited for Hamilton Tour in 2022. \newline

\subsubsection {{\small Small} is {\Large big}}
What's cookin'

\paragraph {What to do when you feel hungry}

\subparagraph {Time to eat out!} Have not had a chance in so long.

\section{Math Equations}
\begin{equation*}
  f(x) = x^2
\end{equation*}
% The automatic numbering is a useful feature, but sometimes it’s necessary to remove them for auxiliary calculations. LaTeX doesn’t allow this by default, now we want to include a package that does


\begin{equation*}
  1 + 2 = 3 
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
  1 = 3 - 2
\end{equation*}

\paragraph{trying out alignment}
\begin{align*}
    f(x) &= x^2\\
    1 + 2 &= 3\\
  1 &= 3 - 2
\end{align*}
\subparagraph{LOL I don't quite like how this looks}

\ldots{} and here it ends.
